# Cpp2IL

WIP Tool to reverse Unity's IL2CPP build process back to the original managed DLLs.

Get the latest CI build [here](https://github.com/SamboyCoding/Cpp2IL/actions?query=is%3Asuccess) - select the topmost (most recent) build and then select the build appropriate to your platform.

Uses .NET Core 3.1, SharpDiasm, and Mono's Cecil.
